## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)**
- **React Router DOM**
- **CSS (Flexbox-based layout)**
- **react-icons**
- **Intersection Observer API (scroll animations)**

---

## 🧠 Design & UX Decisions

- **Routing + Homepage Composition:**  
  The homepage (`/`) renders all sections together, while individual routes render focused views for specific sections. This mirrors real-world SaaS product behavior.

- **Scroll Animations:**  
  Implemented using Intersection Observer for better performance instead of heavy animation libraries.

- **Sticky Footer:**  
  Achieved using Flexbox layout instead of fixed positioning to ensure correct behavior across all screen sizes.

- **Alerts for CTAs:**  
  Used to simulate user interactions in the absence of backend integration.
